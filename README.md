# Algorithms
C++ implementation of popular algorithms which are taught in 'Introduction to Algorithms' courses.
I've created this repo while I was getting started with DSA and programming.


It will be helpful for beginners who are getting started with DSA and programming.

	04. Merge Sort
	05. Quick Sort
	06. Heap Sort

### Greedy Algorithms:
	01. Fractional Knapsack
	02. Job Sequencing
	03. Huffman Coding
	04. Optimal Merge Pattern
	05. Kruskal's Algorithm for MST
	06. Prim's Algorithm for MST
	07. Dijkstra's Algorithm for SSSP

### Divide and Conquer:
	01. MaxMin in the given array
	02. Power of an element
	03. Binary Search
	04. Merge Sort
	05. Quick Sort
	06. Selection Procedure
	07. Number of Inversions

### Graph and Tree Traversals:
	01. Inorder, Preorder and Postorder Traversals
	02. Breadth First Search
